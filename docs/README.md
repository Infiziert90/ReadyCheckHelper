# WaymarkPresetPlugin

## Purpose
**WARNING: BETA PLUGIN**

This is a plugin for [XIVLauncher/Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) that extends the game's ready check.

## Usage
This plugin works automatically, writing out the names of those that were not ready in the chat following a ready check so that you don't have to catch the few seconds the game gives you to open the ready check window before it disappears.  The text emitted will look something like:
```
Ready check complete.
Ready: 19/24
Not Ready: 5/24
Not Ready: Cloud Strife, Terra Branford, Zidane Tribal, and two others.
```
You can configure the number of names shown before you get an "and \<x\> others" in the settings window for the plugin.
