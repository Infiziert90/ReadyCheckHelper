Maybe:
-Check food durations for synced Extremes, Savages, and Ultimates when ready checking.

Bugs:
-In crossworld party, CID in the ready check data becomes zero if a person DCs, making the existing logic not work in that case.  Maybe cache the IDs at the start of a ready check?
	-This doesn't always happen, but as a related issue, might want to make ready check status 4 count in the chat message as not ready.


Priority:
	Drawing on party/alliance lists:
		-Figure out why in-instance alliances aren't drawing.  (This is probably due to incorrect offsets in HudManager).
		-Dirty the data when the party changes.
		-Add option for top or bottom placement of icon positioning.  (Or user-configurable offsets)
		-Find better unknown icon texture.
		-Dirty the data when logging out/switching characters.
		-Implement proper cancellation of the clear overlay task when a new ready check is started.  It'll still be funky as-is if you have a long clear time configured.

	Debug stuff:
		-Add rest of ready check object bytes to raw debug window.
		-Monospace font.

	Misc:
		-Figure out if/how we can show the game's ready check window from the text link.
