General:
-See if we can find a function for ready check data sent or something so we can know that a ready check is going on and the data is valid before it completes for the non-initiator.

Maybe:
-Check food durations for synced Extremes, Savages, and Ultimates when ready checking.

Bugs:
-In crossworld party, CID in the ready check data becomes zero if a person DCs, making the existing logic not work in that case.  Maybe cache the IDs at the start of a ready check?


Priority:
	Drawing on party/alliance lists:
		-Pass in correlated/processed/sorted ready check info.
		-Determine which player corresponds to which party/alliance list index.

	Debug stuff:
		-Add rest of ready check object bytes to raw debug window.

	Text info:
		-Check and hook up text link handler.

	Misc:
		-Add a basic ready check results window to bring up when the in-game one isn't available.
