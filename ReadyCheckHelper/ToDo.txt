Maybe:
-Check food durations for synced Extremes, Savages, and Ultimates when ready checking.

Bugs:
-In crossworld party, CID in the ready check data becomes zero if a person DCs, making the existing logic not work in that case.  Maybe cache the IDs at the start of a ready check?


Priority:
	Drawing on party/alliance lists:
		-Figure out why in-instance alliances aren't drawing.
		-Add option to dirty the ready check and remove it from the party list after a set period of time
		-Dirty the data when the party changes.
		-Clean up positioning on icons, check at various party list scales.
		-Add option for top or bottom placement of icon positioning.
		-Find better unknown icon texture.

	Debug stuff:
		-Add rest of ready check object bytes to raw debug window.

	Misc:
		-Figure out if/how we can show the game's ready check window from the text link.
		-Localization
